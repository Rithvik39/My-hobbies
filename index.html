            <h3 id="bio">I love playing cricket. Cricket is my passion and I want to become a great cricketer.<br> I play cricket by myself and sometimes my father. He to knows how to play cricket and tells me some tricks.<br> Playing with my father is so fun. By practising cricket I get to know how to hit the ball by the way the bowler is bowling.<br> If I am bowling, I get to know how to bowl with tricks and get the batsman out. Cricket also has to do with mind.<br> With my mind I can think if I should hit the ball with power or hit the ball slowly. It also applies in bowling.<br> By mind I can know where to bowl and confuse the batsman by bowling at different places.</h3>
